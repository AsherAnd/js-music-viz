# Javascript Music Visualizer

This is a Javascript Music Visualizer I made with p5.JS which:

- plays and visualizes music from a local playlist
- visualizes music in 4 different ways
- visualizes mircophone audio (currently buggy)

## Currently Working on:

- ~~Quick playlist display~~
- ~~Loop~~/Shuffle feature
- Spotify integration
- Audio selection from playlist display
